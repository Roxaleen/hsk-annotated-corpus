一九五三年开始办社的时候，人们把它叫做「穷棒子社」。,"When the co-operative was first set up in 1953, people called it the ""paupers' co-op""."

今年要求在全国各方面提倡节约，反对浪费。,This year we are calling for economy and the elimination of waste in every sphere throughout the country.
共产党同各民主党派长期共存，这是我们的愿望，也是我们的方针。,It is our desire as well as our policy to exist side by side with the democratic parties for a long time to come.
各党派互相监督的事实，也早已存在，就是各党派互相提意见，作批评。,"Mutual supervision among the various parties is also a long-established fact, in the sense that they have long been advising and criticizing each other."
事实上，唯心主义者不是每天都在用各种形式批评马克思主义吗？,"In fact, aren't the idealists criticizing Marxism every day and in every way?"

在这个广大的领土之上，有广大的肥田沃地，给我们以衣食之源。,In this vast country of ours there are large areas of fertile land which provide us with food and clothing.
割地之外，又索去了巨大的赔款。,"In addition to annexing territory, they exacted huge indemnities."
这些矛盾的斗争及其尖锐化，就不能不造成日益发展的革命运动。,These contradictions and their intensification must inevitably result in the incessant growth of revolutionary movements.
在这样的敌人面前，中国革命的长期性和残酷性就发生了。,"In the face of such enemies, the Chinese revolution cannot be other than protracted and ruthless."
君子之儒，忠君爱国，守正恶邪，务使泽及当时，名留后世。,"A True scholar is loyal to his sovereign and loves his country, abiding by the right and hating evil, eager to benefit the men of his time and leave a good name to posterity."

我们对于大资产阶级投降派的政策是把他们当作敌人看待，坚决地打倒他们。,Our policy towards the big bourgeois capitulationists is to treat them as enemies and resolutely strike them down.
民族资产阶级是带两重性的阶级。,The national bourgeoisie is a class with a dual character.
这种三民主义即是孙中山的三大政策，即联俄、联共和扶助农工政策的三民主义。,"These Three People's Principles embody Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies—alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers."
过去我们就是鉴于他们的经验教训，少走了一些弯路，现在当然更要引以为戒。,"It was by drawing lessons from their experience that we were able to avoid certain detours in the past, and there is all the more reason for us to do so now."
他是主管，说话怎能不作准？,"He is the boss, how can his words not matter?"
工农业品的交换，我们是采取缩小剪刀差，等价交换或者近乎等价交换的政策。,"In the exchange of industrial and agricultural products we follow a policy of narrowing the price scissors, a policy of exchanging equal or roughly equal values."
处理好中央和地方的关系，这对于我们这样的大国大党是一个十分重要的问题。,For a large country like ours and a big Party like ours the proper handling of the relationship between the central and local authorities is of vital importance.
我们的宪法规定，立法权集中在中央。,"According to our Constitution, the legislative powers are all vested in the central authorities."
密率，圆径一百一十三，圆周三百五十五。约率，圆径七，周二十二。,"The minute ratio: diameter 113, circumference 355. The simple ratio: diameter 7, circumference 22."
社会上的反革命因为是老百姓的直接冤头，老百姓恨透了，所以少数人还是要杀。,"Counter-revolutionaries in society are the mortal and immediate enemies of the people and are deeply hated by them, and therefore a small number should be executed."
倒是没有犯过错误的人容易犯错误，因为他容易把尾巴翘得高。,"On the other hand, since it is easier for those who have not erred to become cocky, they are prone to make mistakes."
但是，必须有分析有批判地学，不能盲目地学，不能一切照抄，机械搬用。,"But we must learn with an analytical and critical eye, not blindly, and we mustn't copy everything indiscriminately and transplant mechanically."
正是：替天行道人将至，仗义疏财汉便来。,Indeed: The man to enforce the Way on behalf of Heaven is coming; the gallant to finance the upholding of justice will arrive soon.
不可以色色！,No horny! (Internet meme)
有三个人没有饭吃，乡政府和互济会就马上捐米救济他们。,"In another instance, three persons were starving, so the township government and the mutual-aid society immediately gave them rice."
去年夏荒，乡政府从二百多里的公略县办了米来救济群众。,"During the food shortage last summer, the township government obtained rice from Kunglueh County, more than two hundred li away, for the relief of the masses."
要使广大群众认识我们是代表他们的利益的，是和他们呼吸相通的。,"We should convince the masses that we represent their interests, that our lives are intimately bound up with theirs."
一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。,All such problems concerning the well-being of the masses should be placed on our agenda.

若不听从，就要被刀杀灭，无知无识而死。,"But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge."
对象都不是无知无识的愚民，他们多少也懂得一点，他们对我的谈话很有兴趣。,The people I have talked to are by no means ignoramuses; they all have some understanding of what is going on and are very interested in what I have to say.
例如妥协的空气时起时伏，主张妥协者的根据就是「再战必亡」。,"For instance, from time to time an atmosphere of compromise arises and the advocates of compromise argue that ""the continuance of the war spells subjugation""."
我们胜了，日阀就在精神上失了立场，只有静候末日审判。,"If we win, the Japanese warlords will be demoralized and able only to await their Day of Judgement."
这就是所谓日本战争的退步性。,This is what we mean by the retrogressive nature of Japan's war.
日本战争的退步性和野蛮性是日本战争必然失败的主要根据。,The reactionary and barbarous character of Japan's war constitutes the primary reason for her inevitable defeat.
这个特点的具体反映是日本的退步和寡助，中国的进步和多助。,These characteristics are concretely reflected in Japan's retrogression and paucity of support and in China's progress and abundance of support.
我发现我最近只要一心情难过，家长就开始发我小时候照片，性别焦虑拉满了。,"I found out that recently, whenever I got sad, my parents would send me photos of me in my childhood, which triggered my gender dysphoria."
今天的世界的人民运动，正在以空前的大规模和空前的深刻性发展着。,The popular movements in the world today are developing on a scale and with a depth that are unprecedented.
我们依然是一个弱国，我们在军力、经济力和政治组织力各方面都显得不如敌人。,"We are still a weak country and manifestly inferior to the enemy in military, economic and political-organizational power."
中国是如日方升的国家，这同日本帝国主义的没落状态恰是相反的对照。,"By contrast with Japanese imperialism, which is declining, China is a country rising like the morning sun."
在太阳旗下，每个中国人只能当顺民，做牛马，不许有一丝一毫的中国气。,"Under the flag of the ""Rising Sun"" all Chinese are forced to be docile subjects, beasts of burden forbidden to show the slightest trace of Chinese national spirit."
空前强大的社会主义的苏联，它和中国是历来休戚相关的。,"The socialist Soviet Union, now strong as never before, has always shared China's joys and sorrows."
他笔底下来得快。,He is a facile writer.
而且对于中国现在看惯了斜眼削肩的美女图的眼睛，也是很有澄清的益处的。,
由于全体演员的努力，最精彩的结幕便能很好地演出来。,And through the efforts of the entire cast it will become possible to perform a most brilliant last act.
这样看来，战争的长期性和随之而来的残酷性，是明显的。,It is thus obvious that the war is protracted and consequently ruthless in nature.
总合这些力量就能形成中国的优势，完成反攻的准备。,It is the combination of all these forces that will bring about China's superiority and the completion of her preparations for the counter-offensive.
兵民是胜利之本。,The army and the people are the foundation of victory.

因为前者，于是利用地形地物，采取跃进运动，疏开队形，种种方法都发生了。,"The former gives rise to such techniques as making use of the terrain and its features, advancing in spurts, and spreading out in dispersed formation."
因为后者，于是扫清射界，组织火网，种种方法也发生了。,"The latter gives rise to other techniques, such as clearing the field of fire and organizing a fire-net."
为了实行速决，一般应不打驻止中之敌，而打运动中之敌。,"In general, to achieve quick decision, we should attack a moving and not a stationary enemy."
就能大大地沮丧敌人的精神，振起我军的士气，号召世界的声援。,"It would greatly demoralize the enemy, stimulate the morale of our own forces and evoke international support."
我是速决，敌虽企图持久待援，但不能由他作主。,"And we shall seek quick decisions, while the enemy, try as he may, will not be able to protract the fighting in the expectation of reinforcements."
要做到这些，先决条件是优越的民众组织。,Excellent organization of the masses is the prerequisite for attaining all this.
敌之在台儿庄失败和山西困处，就是显证。,The enemy's defeat at Tai'erzhuang and his predicament in Shanxi prove this clearly.
我在敌后游击战争的广大发展，则使其占领地的守军完全处于被动地位。,The widespread development of guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear has placed his garrisons in the occupied areas in a completely passive position.
将敌军对我军的战略上的分进合击，改为我军对敌军的战役或战斗上的分进合击。,We can change the converging attack directed by the enemy against us on the plane of strategy into converging attacks directed by us against the enemy on the plane of campaigns and battles.
我们是持久论和最后胜利论者，不是赌汉们那样的孤注一掷论者。,"We are for protracted war and final victory, we are not gamblers who risk everything on a single throw."
战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。,The richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people.
那些希望日本资产阶级中和派出来停止战争的，仅仅是一种幻想而已。,Those who hope that the moderates among the Japanese bourgeoisie will come forward and stop the war are only harbouring illusions.
岂有如此广土众民的国家而患财穷之理？,Why should a country as large and populous [as China] suffer from lack of funds?

最大的和最残酷的非正义的反革命的战争，迫临在我们的头上。,The biggest and most ruthless of unjust counter-revolutionary wars is hanging over us.
我们应该学习它，具体地说，学北伐战争的长驱直进和夺取大城市。,"We must learn from it, or, to put it more concretely, we must imitate the Northern Expedition in driving straight ahead to seize the big cities."
这件事情已经不是什么秘密，敌人一般地都摸熟我们的脾气了。,"That is no longer a secret, and in general the enemy is by now well acquainted with our way."
鲁莽家不知改变，或不愿改变，只是一味盲干，结果又非碰壁不可。,"A rash person who does not understand the need for such alterations or is unwilling to make them, but who acts blindly, will inevitably run their head against a brick wall."

消极防御，又叫专守防御，又叫单纯防御。,Passive defence is also known as purely defensive defence or pure defence.
中国战史中合此原则而取胜的实例是非常之多的。,China's military history contains numerous instances of victories won on these principles.
假如这样，又假如突围后的领导稍为聪明一点，情况便将有很大的不同。,"If that had been done, and if the leadership had been a little wiser after our breakthrough, the outcome would have been very different."
对于几乎一切都取给于敌方的红军，基本的方针是歼灭战。,"For the Red Army which gets almost all its supplies from the enemy, war of annihilation is the basic policy."
你并非孤军作战。,You are not alone.
可以说我们已经脱离了过去的那种慢慢发展的孤军作战的景况。,It can be said that we have outgrown the past state of slow development and fighting in isolation.
红军虽弱，却养精蓄锐，以逸待劳。,"But the Red Army, though weak, has conserved its strength and stored up its energy, and is waiting at its ease [for the fatigued enemy]."
我们只有使自己操练得高人一等，才有战略胜利的可能。,Only when we have trained ourselves to be a head taller than the enemy will strategic victories be possible.
人人皆知以多胜少是最好的办法，然而很多人不能做，相反地每每分散兵力。,"Everybody knows that the best way is to use a large force to defeat a small one, and yet many people fail to do so and on the contrary often divide their forces up."
有时退到该地区还无隙可乘，便不得不再退几步，待敌发生可乘之「隙」。,"Sometimes when we have retreated to the predetermined area and not yet found openings to exploit, we have to retreat farther and wait for the enemy to give us an opening."
实在是一种鲁莽灭裂的干法。,This was really rash and foolhardy conduct.
并且不放弃土地又能打胜敌人不是更好些吗？,"Moreover, was it not better to defeat the enemy without abandoning territory?"
都是双方强弱不同，弱者先让一步，后发制人，因而战胜的。,"In each case the contending sides were unequal, and the weaker side, yielding some ground at first, gained mastery by striking only after the enemy had struck and so defeated the stronger side."
心目中没有集体生活的原则，只有自由放任。,To show no regard at all for the principles of collective life but to follow one's own inclination.
自以为对革命有功，摆老资格，大事做不来，小事又不做，工作随便，学习松懈。,"To regard oneself as having rendered great service to the revolution, to pride oneself on being a veteran, to disdain minor assignments while being quite unequal to major tasks, to be slipshod in work and slack in study."
大家以为有了出路，愁眉锁眼的姿态为之一扫。,"There is a general feeling that a way out of the impasse has been found, and people no longer knit their brows in despair."
对于全国先进的文化工作者，我们的东西，只当作引玉之砖，千虑之一得。,Our observations may contain a grain of truth for the nation's advanced cultural workers and may serve as a modest spur to induce them to come forward with valuable contributions of their own.
大敌当前，他们要联合工农反对敌人；工农觉悟，他们又联合敌人反对工农。,"When confronted by a formidable enemy, they united with the workers and peasants against the enemy, but when the workers and peasants awakened, they turned round to unite with the enemy against the workers and peasants."
再不变计，民族的命运是非常危险的。,"If we don't change our plan, our national future will be gravely imperilled."
扫除农村中的封建关系，把土地变为农民的私产。,"Abolish feudal relations in the rural areas, and turn the land over to the private ownership of the peasants."
但是他们做贼心虚，怕共产党阻挡他们的去路，更怕老百姓骂汉奸。,"But, with the cowardice of thieves, they fear that the Communists will block their exit and, what is more, that the common people will brand them as traitors."
于是打伙儿地开了个会，决议：事先要在文化界舆论界准备一下。,So they have put their heads together and decided to prepare the ground in cultural circles and through the press.

其声势之浩大，威力之猛烈，简直是所向无敌的。,Its influence has been so great and its impact so powerful that it is invincible wherever it goes.
至于盟长资格，就不得不落在无产阶级文化思想的肩上。,Inevitably the responsibility for leading the alliance rested on proletarian culture and ideology.
这就增加了共产党批评同盟者、揭破假革命、争取领导权的责任。,"This increases the responsibility devolving on the Communist Party to criticize its allies, unmask the fake revolutionaries, and gain the leadership."
谁怀疑我们领导革命战争的能力，谁就会陷进机会主义的泥坑里去。,Whoever questions our ability to lead the revolutionary war will fall into the morass of opportunism.
